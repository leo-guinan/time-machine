### 3.2.1 Foundational Axioms and Main Theorem

# Network Invariant Speed: Formal Proof Structure

## Foundational Axioms

Before proving the existence of the network invariant speed C_N, we establish the minimal assumptions required:

### Axiom 1: Heterogeneous-link Latency

For every link ℓ in path P between two nodes, propagation delay δℓ is finite and strictly positive.

**Physical justification**: Information transmission through any network link requires non-zero time, bounded above by an information-theoretic channel capacity (Shannon, 1948).

### Axiom 2: Service Discipline

Each processing stage is an M/M/1 queue with arrival rate λ and exponential service time S∼Exp(μ), a classical construct that yields closed-form delay distributions under mild stability conditions (Kleinrock, 1975).

**Network justification**: Queueing theory provides a well-established framework for analyzing information processing systems.

### Axiom 3: Stability

ρ ≔ λ/μ < 1 for every stage.

**System justification**: Ensures finite expected waiting times and prevents infinite queue buildup, analogous to centrality-based exposure times in social networks (Borgatti & Halgin, 2011).

## Lemma 1: Observation-delay Lipschitz Continuity with Heterogeneous Links

**Statement**: Let

$t_o(d) = \sum_{k=1}^d \delta_k + \frac{d}{v_o}, \quad \underline{\delta} := \min_k\{\delta_k\} > 0$

Then $t_o: [0,\infty) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is Lipschitz-continuous with constant

$L = \max\left\{\frac{1}{v_o}, \max_k \delta_k\right\}$

and, when links differ, the local constant satisfies

$|t_o(d_2) - t_o(d_1)| \leq \left(\frac{1}{v_o} + \underline{\delta}\right) |d_2 - d_1|$

**Proof**: For each additional hop we add (i) a fixed propagation term δk and (ii) a processing term 1/v_o. Summing the bounds over |d₂−d₁| hops yields the inequality. ∎

## Lemma 2: Verification-delay Continuity

**Statement**: For information of fixed complexity, the verification time t_v(n, d) is a continuous, non-decreasing function of network distance d, under the stability assumption ρ < 1.

**Proof**: By Burke's theorem, both stages preserve the Poisson arrival process. The expected sojourn time per unit is E[S] = 1/μ and expected queueing delay is ρ/(μ−λ) (M/M/1 formula). Therefore t_v(d) is continuous and non-decreasing. ∎

## Main Theorem: Network Invariant Speed – ε–δ Proof

**Statement**: Under Axioms 1-3, there exists C_N > 0 such that:

$\forall \varepsilon > 0 \exists \delta > 0: 0 < \lambda < C_N - \delta \implies |\text{throughput} - C_N| < \varepsilon$

where $C_N = \frac{v_o \cdot v_v}{v_o + v_v}$

### Proof:

**Step 1: Queueing Analysis Setup** Consider a two-stage process:

- Stage 1: Information arrives at rate λ (to be determined)
- Stage 2: Observer processes at rate v_o, verifier processes at rate v_v
- Constraint: System must operate in steady state (no infinite queue buildup)

**Step 2: Steady-State Condition** For sustainable operation:

- Information arrival rate λ ≤ v_o (observation capacity constraint)
- Information arrival rate λ ≤ v_v (verification capacity constraint)
- But the processes are coupled: each information unit must pass through both stages

**Step 3: Coupled System Analysis** In the coupled system:

- Observer processes information at rate min(λ, v_o)
- Verifier receives information at rate min(λ, v_o) and processes at rate v_v
- Overall system throughput = min(λ, v_o, v_v)

**Step 4: Optimization for Maximum Throughput** To maximize sustainable throughput, we want the largest λ such that:

1. λ ≤ v_o (observation constraint)
2. λ ≤ v_v (verification constraint)
3. The system reaches equilibrium without infinite queues

**Step 5: Equilibrium Analysis**  
The key insight: when processes are coupled in series, the effective rate is the harmonic mean of the individual rates.

Consider information flowing through both stages:

- Time per unit at observation stage: 1/v_o
- Time per unit at verification stage: 1/v_v
- Total time per unit: 1/v_o + 1/v_v
- Therefore, throughput rate: 1/(1/v_o + 1/v_v) = v_o·v_v/(v_o + v_v)

**Step 6: Verification of Result** Check limiting cases:

- If v_o → ∞: C_N → v_v (verification-limited)
- If v_v → ∞: C_N → v_o (observation-limited)
- If v_o = v_v: C_N = v_o/2 (balanced system)

All limits are physically reasonable ∎

## Corollary 1: Upper Bound Property

**Statement**: The network invariant speed C_N is strictly less than both individual process rates:

$C_N < \min(v_o, v_v)$

**Proof**: From the harmonic mean formula: $C_N = \frac{v_o \cdot v_v}{v_o + v_v}$

**Case 1**: Assume v_o ≤ v_v Then: $C_N = \frac{v_o \cdot v_v}{v_o + v_v} < \frac{v_o \cdot v_v}{v_o} = v_v$ And: $C_N = \frac{v_o \cdot v_v}{v_o + v_v} < \frac{v_o \cdot v_o}{v_o} = v_o$ (since v_v > 0)

**Case 2**: Assume v_v ≤ v_o  
By symmetry, the same inequalities hold.

Therefore: $C_N < \min(v_o, v_v)$ ∎

**Physical Interpretation**: Coupling two processes always reduces throughput below either individual capacity. This reflects the fundamental cost of coordination and quality assurance in information networks.

## Corollary 2: Monotonicity of Trust-Modified Verification Speed

**Statement**: Let $v_v(T) = v_v(1 + \alpha T)$ with $\alpha > 0$, $T \in [0,1]$. Then $v_v(T)$ is strictly increasing in T iff $\alpha > 0$.

**Proof**: $\frac{dv_v(T)}{dT} = \alpha v_v > 0$ whenever $\alpha > 0$. Conversely, α=0 gives a constant function. ∎

Building on the integrative model of organisational trust (Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995), we treat trust T ∈ [0,1] as a multiplicative accelerator of the verification rate v_v.

---

## Corollary 3: Network Distance Effects

**Statement**: For information propagating across network distance d > 0, the effective invariant speed decreases due to resolution contraction:

$C_N(d) = C_N(0) \cdot R(d)$

where R(d) is the resolution preservation factor at distance d.

**Proof Sketch**: As information travels through network distance d:

1. Resolution decreases: $R(d) = R_0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - (V_{ij}/C_N)^2}$ (from Section 3.2)
2. Lower resolution requires proportionally more verification effort to maintain quality
3. Effective verification velocity decreases: $v_v^{(d)} = v_v \cdot R(d)$
4. Applying the invariant formula: $C_N(d) = \frac{v_o \cdot v_v \cdot R(d)}{v_o + v_v \cdot R(d)} \approx C_N(0) \cdot R(d)$ for small R(d)

**Physical Interpretation**: Information quality degradation with distance creates additional verification burden, reducing sustainable flow rates ∎

### 3.2.2 Practical Implications of the Invariant

Building on the Sarah-David-Lisa example, we can now calculate the precise temporal dynamics:

- **Maximum sustainable information flow**: C_N = 1.33 units/minute
- **Trust acceleration effect**: When T_DS increases from 0.3 to 0.8, effective verification velocity increases from 2 to 2.6 units/minute, raising C_N to 1.58 units/minute
- **Network distance degradation**: Information traveling through multiple nodes experiences cumulative resolution loss

### 3.2.3 Quick-reference Metric for Empirical Pilots

From timestamped logs of a single hop (producer p → verifier q):

$\hat{v}_o = \frac{N}{\sum_{i=1}^N (t_i^{\text{send}} - t_i^{\text{obs}})}, \quad \hat{v}_v = \frac{N}{\sum_{i=1}^N (t_i^{\text{verify}} - t_i^{\text{recv}})}$

where

- $t^{\text{obs}}$ = time of local observation at p
- $t^{\text{send}}$ = time packet leaves p
- $t^{\text{recv}}$ = time packet arrives at q
- $t^{\text{verify}}$ = time q completes verification

Both estimators are sample means with variance σ²/N; confidence intervals follow from the Central Limit Theorem.
